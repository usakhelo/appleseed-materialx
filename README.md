Experiments with MaterialX and appleseed renderer

## Long-term roadmap:
 - Construct and compile appleseed osl shader from .mtlx files
 - Convert appleseed shaders to .mtlx from studio and/or DCC plugin
 - Alternative to MaterialXViewer with interactive appleseed renderer
 - Export nodes and material assignments from appleseed studio to .mtlx file
 - Import .mtlx into DCC application and appleseed.studio
