Experiments with [MaterialX](https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX) and [appleseed renderer](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed)

## Roadmap:
 - Python script to build appleseed mtlx library
 - Generate and compile appleseed OSL shaders from .mtlx files
 - Convert appleseed shaders to .mtlx from studio and/or DCC plugin
 - Alternative to MaterialXViewer with interactive appleseed renderer
 - Export nodes and material assignments from appleseed studio to .mtlx file
 - Import .mtlx into DCC application and appleseed.studio
